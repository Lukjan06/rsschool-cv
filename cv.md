## **Some words about myself**

I have no axperience in Front-end yet, but I want to become a good programmer and work in different interesting projects.I work well in a team, easily find an approach to a person and can plan my time. And you know, it's very important for me to see the result of my work and coding. Today I do all my best to get all necessary knowledge of understanding and learning coding on JS, HTML and CSS.

Now I'm learning on RS-School and I suppose that'll give me a chance to start my career and become a professional programmer.
